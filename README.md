# Proximal-Policy-Optimization
Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actorâ€“critic (AC) architecture. In the classic AC architecture, the Critic (value) network is used to estimate the value function while the Actor (policy) network optimizes the policy according to the estimated value function.

One Implemented with only numpy and other with pytorch, the only difference was that the pytorch has automatic differentiatio aka adam optimizer which makes the model more successfull.
