# Proximal-Policy-Optimization
Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actorâ€“critic (AC) architecture. In the classic AC architecture, the Critic (value) network is used to estimate the value function while the Actor (policy) network optimizes the policy according to the estimated value function.
